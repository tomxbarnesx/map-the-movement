							<p style={{paddingLeft: "1em"}}>Across the United States, police violence cuts hundreds of lives short every year and instills a daily fear in Black and brown communities. A 2018 study from the Department of Justice detailed how in the year prior to the study, hundreds of thousands of Black people reported being subjected to excessive use of force from police ‚Äî at around double the rate of white people.</p>
							<p style={{paddingLeft: "1em"}}>In the wake of George Floyd‚Äôs murder, the movement for Black lives gained support and attention not seen since the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Much of that attention has been focused on a few major national organizations fighting police brutality and racial injustice, but behind the big names are hundreds of local groups, working on the ground to end overpolicing and mass incarceration.</p>
							<p style={{paddingLeft: "1em"}}>#MapTheMovement aims to shine a light on the many grassroots organizations fighting to end racist policing and provide a resource for people to find them, share them, and donate to help further their work. This project was inspired by a documentary from Frame, which tells the story of Rolanda Byrd, who lost her son to police violence in 2016, and became the Executive Director of Raleigh PACT, an organization in Raleigh, North Carolina working to stop police brutality.</p>
							<p style={{paddingLeft: "1em"}}>Watch the film below and explore, share, and learn about the myriad organizations like Raleigh PACT, on the map. Within everybody‚Äôs neighborhood, there is likely a group fighting to fix the U.S.‚Äô unjust police and carceral state ‚Äî we hope you use this map to find and engage with yours.</p>
							{/*<p style={{paddingLeft: "1em"}}><em>Historically police reform in the U.S. has been a long, slow process. Impunity for police misconduct and a warrior culture are deeply entrenched norms in many police departments across the country, and it often takes monumental local effort to spur reform.</em></p>
							<p style={{paddingLeft: "1em"}}><em>Each year, researchers from around the world gather at Neural Information Processing Systems, an artificial-intelligence conference, to discuss automated translation software, self-driving cars, and abstract mathematical questions. It was odd, therefore, when Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University, gave a presentation at the 2018 conference, which was held in Montreal. Fifty-one, with light-green eyes and a dark beard that lend him a mischievous air, Levin studies how bodies grow, heal, and, in some cases, regenerate.</em></p>
							<p style={{paddingLeft: "1em"}}><em>No one reform package has solved every apparent problem in U.S. policing. Still, there are interesting experiments in alternative justice, police oversight, and use-of-force protocols going on around the country.</em></p>*/}
